## Challenges Faced

1. **Expo Go Connection Issues:**
   - Initially, the app wouldn't load on my physical device. I resolved this by ensuring both my computer and phone were on the same Wi-Fi network.

2. **Styling in React Native:**
   - I struggled with aligning components properly. Using `flexbox` and `StyleSheet` helped me achieve the desired layout.

3. **TypeScript Errors:**
   - I encountered TypeScript errors when using custom props. Adding proper type definitions resolved the issue.
